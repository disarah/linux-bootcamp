Once upon a time there was a good programmer who used git. He committed
regularly and wrote useful messages.

One day, he wrote buggy code! But thankfully he was able to reset to an
earlier commit. Instead of having to rewrite his entire project, he was
able to just restart the buggy feature.

And then he ate some snacks and he was able to code for 50 years. The End.
