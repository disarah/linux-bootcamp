Once upon a time there was a good programmer who used git. He committed
regularly and wrote useful messages.

One day, he wrote buggy code! But thankfully he was able to reset to an
earlier commit. Instead of having to rewrite his entire project, he was
able to just restart the buggy feature.

And then he ate some snacks and he was able to code for 50 years. The End.
Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to.

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

So then he failed the class. Next time he started using git and has now come to love git even though it's confusing. The End.
